# Portfolio

This GitHub repository contains my captivating 3D portfolio website built using cutting-edge technologies such as ThreeJS, React Three Fiber, TailwindCSS, and Framer Motion. The combination of these powerful libraries and frameworks allows creating a visually stunning and interactive website that showcases 3D models and graphics.

It includes various sections carefully designed to highlight different aspects of my professional profile. The ***Homepage*** welcomes visitors with an immersive and visually captivating 3D computer model, setting the tone for the rest of the website. The ***About*** section provides an insightful glimpse into my background, experience, and aspirations. The ***Education**** section details my academic journey, highlighting my qualifications and areas of expertise. The ***Skills*** section showcases my proficiency in various relevant technologies. The ***Projects*** section presents a curated selection of my notable works, allowing visitors to explore my portfolio.Finally, the website includes a dedicated ***Contact*** section for visitors to contact me via email (using EmailJS), ensuring seamless communication for potential clients or collaborators.

Together, these sections create a comprehensive and engaging 3D portfolio website that effectively showcases my skills, experiences, and expertise.
